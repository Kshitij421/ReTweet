This is a web application which keeps track of tweets coming to my account and if this tweets are feedback , complaint or query then automatically  re-tweet to them. If tweet is complaint then it will reply as "We are sorry. Our customer rep will contact you shortly". For this  I use IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier Service and Red-Node for Development.This is sample or you which show how to create this application.
